Just type this

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

and then type A

and after that, you can execute whatever you want without warnings or anything for that powershell session, until you close powershell.

There may be a way to do this permanently for powershell, but this is a security risk, thus I advise doing this for the current session.
